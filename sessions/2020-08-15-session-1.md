# Session 1

## The Hook: Meet Me in Phandalin

You stand outside the Driftwood Tavern in the city of Neverwinter. You were summoned here by your friend Gundren Rockseeker, with whom you share a long history. Gundren's summoning message provided scant detail; it just indicated the time and place to meet and included two words: "Help needed!" You step inside the tavern.

Gundren has already arrived and is seated with several others you do not recognize. The old dwarf waves you over to his table. He shows little emotion, which is typical for him, but as you near the table you notice that his eyes seem different. They look happier, or perhaps more excited, than you have ever seen. 

You find your seat.

Gundren exchanges greetings with you and quickly moves through the customary pleasantries. He is hurrying and definitely excited. He asks you all to greet one another and to introduce yourselves, saying matter-of-factly, "You'll all be spendin' more time together soon enough." You introduce yourself in turn along with the others.

The last person at the table to introduce themself is a older human man sitting to the right of Gundren. He is clothed simply and plainly with the notable exception that his heavy cloak is pinned with a Lord's Alliance broach. His dark hair, flecked with silver, is tied back in a pony tail and his thick beard is neatly trimmed. He speaks slowly, with the tone and cadence of a military leader.

"My name is Sildar Hallwinter. Like you all, Gundren and I have known each another for a very long time. We have fought and we have bled together. But those are stories for another day."

"I am retired from the watch and now work full time on behalf of the Alliance. I have a taken leave from my duties to be here, to help Gundren the same as you all. I am a rare old soldier who has lived long and well enough to retire, but I am still deadly with my sword, and my mind is still just as sharp."

Sildar drinks from his cup of wine to show he is finished speaking. Gundren nods and takes his turn.

"Me an' my brothers have found somethin' big to the southeast near the town of Phandalin. I can't say more than that just yet. They're there now, and needin' me to join them in a hurry with provisions. We have some timely business that needs takin' care of. I have a loaded wagon waitin' to go, and just need a group to get it to Barthen's in Phandalin. That's what I am asking y'all to do."

"It's two days with a wagon to the Triboar Trail," Gundren continues, "another day to the trail south to Phandalin, and less than a day to the town itself from there. That'll be four days on the road there an' four days back by foot. The goin' rate for wagon work is 2 gold, and I'll double that, up front, given our history and the need for speed." Gundren drops a bag full of coins onto the table with dramatic thud. "So, that'll be 16 gold dragons each, right now, to help me get this wagon to Phandalin as quick as can be."

A short discussion follows where Gundren answers any questions that you have. He explains that he is leaving immediately with Sildar as his escort to arrive ahead of the wagon as fast as possible. He gives you his marker for the wagon so you can retreive it in the morning to beging your journey. You spent the remainder of the day preparing for an early departure the next morning.

You travel three days and three nights on the High Road south from Neverwinter. Early on the fourth day, you depart the road to veer east along the Triboar Trail. You have encountered no trouble so far, but this area can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk along the trail.
