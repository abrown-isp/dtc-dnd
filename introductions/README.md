# Character Introductions

The characters first meet each other after being summoned by Gundren Rockseeker to the Driftwood Tavern in Neverwinter. During that meeting, Gundren ask everyone to greet one another and introduce themselves. Each players should write their character's greeting and introduction, with some description of their characters appearance, as Markdown file here. As an example, here is Sildar's greeting and introduction:

> The last person at the table to introduce themself is a older human man sitting to the right of Gundren. He is clothed simply and plainly with the notable exception that his heavy cloak is pinned with a Lord's Alliance broach. His dark hair, flecked with silver, is tied back in a pony tail and his thick beard is neatly trimmed. He speaks slowly, with the tone and cadence of a military leader.
>
> "My name is Sildar Hallwinter. Like you all, Gundren and I have known each another for a very long time. We have fought and we have bled together. But those are stories for another day."
>
> "I am retired from the watch and now work full time on behalf of the Alliance. I have a taken leave from my duties to be here, to help Gundren the same as you all. I am a rare old soldier who has lived long and well enough to retire, but I am still deadly with my sword, and my mind is still just as sharp."
